# Data Structures in JavaScript With Examples

## Linked List Data Structure

Linked lists are a type of data structure that store values in the form of a list.
Unlike array, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers. <br />
Within list, each value is considered a node, and each node is connected with the following value in the list (or null in case the element is the last in the list) through a pointer.
